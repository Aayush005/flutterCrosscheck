<h3 id='1'>Introduction</h3>
<br>
Flutter is Googleâ€™s mobile UI framework for crafting high-quality native interfaces on iOS and Android in record 
time. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and
open source. 
<br>

Flutter allows you to build beautiful, native applications for mobile (both Android and IOS), web, and desktop 
from a single codebase.
<br>

In this blog, we'll see how can we install Flutter in Android Studio.
